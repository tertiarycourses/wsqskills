"""Build the WSQ assessment set for 'Application Integration with Docker and Kubernetes' (TGS-2021010366):
  - Written Assessment (SAQ)  — 5 open-ended KNOWLEDGE questions (K1–K5), aligned to the slides
  - Practical Performance (PP) — 4 PRACTICAL tasks (LO1–LO4), aligned to the in-class activities
Each instrument is produced as a Question Paper and a matching Answer Key (4 DOCX total),
all with the WSQ house cover page (same as the Lesson Plan / Learner Guide). Page 1 is the cover;
page 2 carries Trainee Information + Instructions + Grading; the questions/tasks begin on page 3.
